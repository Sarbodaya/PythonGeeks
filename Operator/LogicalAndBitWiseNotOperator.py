# A Python program that uses Logical Not or ! on boolean
a = not True
b = not False
print(a)
print(b)
# Output : False
# Output : True

# A Python program that uses Bitwise Not or ~ on boolean
a = True
b = False
print(~a)
print(~b)

# Reason: The bitwise not operator ~ returns the complement of a number i.e.,
# it switches each 1 to 0 and each 0 to 1. Booleans True and False have values 1 and 0 respectively.
